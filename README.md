This course helps you learn Kubernetes fundamentals right from scratch,  Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) makes deploying and managing containerised applications easy. It offers serverless Kubernetes, backed by power of Azure leveraging features like Active Directory to control fine grained access on who has access to what.

How the course is shaped?

We start off writing terraform script to spin up Azure kubernetes Service along with Azure Container Registry.

Generate secrets for AKS to get deployed.

Deploy Kubernetes Cluster on Azure

Introduction to Kubernetes Dashboard

Deploy dashboard on Azure Kubernetes Service

We push docker images to Azure Container Registry

We start with the fundamentals of kubernetes like namespaces, deployment, services, statefulsets, pods, configmaps

and then the fun part where we start off with deploying workloads on AKS just like you would do it on a production system.

we join the services and get the Kibana UI up and running.

We use rolling update and replica sets to keep the service highly available.

Use a static public IP address and DNS label with the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) load balancer
